.SH DESCRIPTION
A
\fBPEPSaL\fP 
Is a Performance Enhancing Proxy for Satellite links.
It realizes a typical RFC3135 "splitting" Tcp PEP, using the Linux
netfilter package.

A couple of rules must be added via
.B iptables (8)
in order to redirect all the TCP segments to a local port.

Moreover, it uses the new NFQUEUE target to spoof the syn packets incoming
from the clients. See the example iptables script for the default configuration.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p "\fIportnum\fP" 
It is possible to decide which local tcp port to use.
When this option is not specified, pepsal will use default udp port number,
5000.
.TP
.B \-d
Daemon mode: run pepsal in background
.TP
.B \-q "\fIQueuenum\fP"
specify the netfilter queue to be used to spoof SYN packets incoming from the client network.
The default value is "0".
.TP
.B \-a "\fIAddress\fP"
Use the specified Address to bind tcp local port (default: INADDR_ANY)
.TP
.B \-h 
get a brief help
.TP
.B \-v
verbose mode. Useful for debugging.
.SH BUGS
None ;-)
